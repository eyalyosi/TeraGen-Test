# **Fullstack Coding Assessment**

**Welcome to our full-stack coding assessment!**

In this assignment, you are going to create a **Review Manager Popup** component from scratch, and connect it to a backend with a database.

We prepared a design on [figma](https://figma.com). You'll find all the required details on how to create it, already included there. To get your **link to the Figma design**, ask us to share it with you.

## **What you need to do?**

- Clone this repository to your computer
- Create a repository in your private account and change the git origin to your new repository.
- Create a React project based on any react framework you want.
- Create the **UI** based on the Figma project. Please keep aligned with the styles and colors.
- Create a backend with database using a **CRUD** API (**without update**), to manage the reviews creation, retrieval, and deletion.
- Use git and proper commits messages to allow us to track your progression.
- You will need to deploy your project on [Heroku](https://heroku.com) to get it running.

## **Optional tasks**

- Implement import reviews from a CSV file (You can find the format in this repository)
- Implement generic reviews button (You can find the generic reviews in this repository)

## **How to commit**

**Please commit once you start to work on the task, and also when you finish.**

## **What you need to know about the UI?**

- You can use any styling framework you want, but we are preferring [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) or a similar styling framework.

## **What you should know about the backed?**

- You can use any database you want, but you should be able to store and properly retrieve the data.
- The backend has to be a **REST API** or **GRAPH API**.
- The backend has to be a **NodeJS** application.
